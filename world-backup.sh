#Path to your world folder
WORLD="/home/minecraft/world_storage"
WORLD_DIRNAME="`dirname $WORLD`"

#VOLATILE is the path the World symlink is going to be located linked to the 
#NOTE: Make sure your server.properties is pointing to the World_in_RAM
#VOLATILE="$WORLD_DIRNAME/World_in_RAM"
VOLATILE="/dev/shm/minecraft/World_in_RAM/"
#
# WHY DID I CHANGE THIS?!
# Because according to the rsync manual, when it's source dir is pointed
# at a symlink instead of an actual dir, it copies the symlink as well.
# This caused a recursive link to be copied to both physical and volatile
# locations. The new change avoid this.

#A warning every five minutes filled the logs and got really annoying.

# RSYNC
# -r        recursive
# -a        archiving mode (preserve premissions, time, all that stuff.
#           it's more elegant than just preserving time)
# -v        verbose like a sailor
# -u        update, so it doesnt sync fucking everything every single time
# --delete  also remove files from the destination if they were
#           previously removed in the volatile directory
# --force   same as above except allows removing nonempty directories
#
# Also, note the trailing slashes at the end of the directories.
# These ensure we're copying the contents of one directory to the contents of
# another. Rsync gets very picky about this.
